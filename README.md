# odin-recipes

This is the first The Odin Project project.
The end result should be a rudimentary webpage containing different recipes,
and through which I'll be demonstrating what I have learned so far.
I will be using all of the formatting tags learned so far (<strong>,<em>,
<p>,<h1> to <h6>, etc. as well as <a> tags, with its corresponding href =""
element, and <img> tags.
