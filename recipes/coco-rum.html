<h3>Description</h3>
<p>This is one of my favourite cocktails. It was introduced to
    to me by <a href="../recipes/img/nikib.html"><strong>NikiB</strong>
    </a>. In my brother's wedding, and it was a delicious, 
    fruity, and sweet surprise.</p>
<h4>Ingredients: </h4>
    <p>Fortunately I do know the ingredients for this recipe,
        so here they go:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 bottle of Malibu coco rum;</li>
        <li>1 bottle of orange juice;</li>
        <li>Ice.</li>
    </ul>
<h4>Steps:</h4>
    <p>Steps for this cocktail should be relatively straightforward:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Add 50 ml of Malibu coco rum to a cup;</li>
        <li>Add 100 ml of orange juice to the cup;</li>
        <li>Add ice to cool down <em>(maybe the ice should
            have been added before the liquids).</em></li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
